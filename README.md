# Connect4-N
Second graded assignment of the Principles of Programming module at the University of Bath.

This program allows a human to play the game Connect4 against a computer.

We are given a program to work with. Unfortunately, the code:
Doesnâ€™t compile or run.
Is poorly designed (e.g. is largely made up of a huge main function without comments). 
Code needed to be redesigned to adhere to Object Oriented principles.
Needed extension to meet an updated specification (more players, more tokens!).

This assignment was awarded 76% - a distinction.
